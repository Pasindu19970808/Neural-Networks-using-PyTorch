# Neural-Networks-using-PyTorch

5 Different datasets have been investigated using Neural Networks build using PyTorch. Out of the datasets, 4 are binary class datasets and 1 is a multiclass dataset:
- Breast Cancer Dataset (Binary class)
- Diabetes Dataset (Binary class)
- Iris Dataset (Binary class)
- Wine Dataset (Binary class)
- MNIST Dataset (Multi Class)

Stochastic Gradient Descent Optimizer has been used. 

For Binary Class, the final activation function is a Sigmoid function to bound the output between 0 and 1. For Multi Class the final activation function is the Softmax Function

Binary Cross Entropy has been used as a loss function for Binary class datasets, while generalized Cross Entropy function is used for Multi class datasets. 

Result analysis is presented in the Jupyter Notebook
